    "question": "When the joint-stock company was first invented, was there a lot of pushback\non the concept? What were some of the concerns? Also any recommended books on\nthe invention of the concept would be much appreciated!",
    "answer_a": "An early form of joint stock ventures appeared in Assyria by the beginning of\nthe 2nd millennium BCE. There does not seem to have been any noticeable\npushback against the concept, although trade caravans were often taxed\nheavily. Of course, the relevant texts were written to and from people engaged\nin trade, so there's no way of knowing what other Assyrians thought of long\ndistance trade.  \n>Most of these traders had become more independent by having become managers\nof a \"joint-stock fund\" (called *naruqqum*, \"money bag\"), usually set up in\nAssur. This phenomenon appeared for the first time around 1900 BC and seems to\nhave been an Old Assyrian invention that went beyond individual partnerships\nand cooperation in a joint caravan. The arrangement, rather similar to that of\nthe early medieval *compagnia*, meant enlisting a number (usually about a\ndozen) of investors (*ummi\u0101num*, \"financiers\"), who supplied capital rated in\ngold, usually in all ca. 30 kilos, ideally consisting of shares of 1 or 2\nkilos of gold each. It was entrusted to a trader (the tractator), usually for\nca. ten years, for the generally formulated purpose of \"carrying out trade.\"\nThe contract contained stipulations on a final settlement of accounts, on\npaying dividends, on the division of the expected profit, and on fines for\npremature withdrawal of capital (meant to secure the duration of the\nbusiness). Investors or shareholders mostly lived in Assur, but successful\ntraders in Anatolia too invested in funds managed by others, perhaps also as a\nway of sharing commercial risks. In such cases a contract would to be drawn up\nin Anatolia that obliged the tractator \"to book in Assur x gold in his joint\nstock fund in the investor's name.\" Among the investors we find members of the\ntractator's family, but also business relations and others, probably a kind of\n\"merchant-bankers,\" and other rich citizens, who aimed at fairly safe, long-\nterm investments.  \n[\"Ancient Assur: The City, its Traders, and its Commercial\nNetwork\"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25651212) by Klaas Veenhof  \nFor more on Old Assyrian trade and these early joint stock funds, see\n[*Ancient Kanesh: A Merchant Colony in Bronze Age\nAnatolia*](https://books.google.com/books?id=qXGgCgAAQBAJ) by Mogens Larsen.",
    "answer_b": "There was definitely some pushback when the joint-stock company was first\ninvented.

Because both authors take radically different chronological perspectives (one ancient, one very modern), it makes it somewhat difficult to compare them. However, because Answer A is the more detailed, the better supported, and the more technically correct of the two, it is the better option.\n\nIn describing the ancient Assyrian origins of joint-stock financing, Answer A goes into exceptional detail (almost too much detail, in fact, for my taste). It does so comparatively, with reference to the medieval compagnia system, and it also supports its claims with an outside reference. When combined with the linguistic sensitivity on display, I have no doubt that the author of Answer A knows their stuff.\n\nAnswer B, while equally confident (and somewhat correct about the suspicions surrounding the early tycoons of twentieth-century American culture), is less satisfying largely because the joint-stock concept was old news by the time that Vanderbilt started building his fortune. If not in Assyria, as Answer A claims, joint-stock ventures were certainly operating in England and the Dutch Republic, where they helped to finance some of the early transatlantic voyages to North America during the 16th and 17th centuries.",

        "background": "[Question]\nWhy do people go bald on the top of their head and still have some on the\nsides and not vice-versa?\n\n[The Start of Answer 1]\nThere are a few reasons why people go bald on the top of their head and still\nhave some hair on the sides. One reason is that the hair follicles on the top\nof the head are more sensitive to a hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT).\nDHT is a byproduct of testosterone and is found in both men and women. When\nDHT levels are high, it can cause the hair follicles on the top of the head to\nminiaturize, which leads to hair loss. Another reason is that the hair on the\nsides and back of the head is not as exposed to the sun and other\nenvironmental factors, which can damage the hair and lead to hair loss.\n\n[The End of Answer 1]\n\n[The Start of Answer 2]\nSeems unsettled but here\u2019s a theory:  \n\u201cThe most recent hypothesis suggests that the hair loss process begins during\npuberty, when growth of the skull and the muscles in the forehead and neck\nincreases the tension in a tight band of tissue stretching over the top of the\nhead. The more DHT (a type of testosterone) there is, the more these muscles\ncontract, which causes inflammation and brings in more DHT. Over time, the DHT\nthickens the band of tissue, restricting the supply of blood and nutrients to\nthe hair follicles above it. The follicles on top of the head get smaller and\neventually disappear, while those on the sides of the head remain largely\nunaffected.\u201d  \nSource  \nhttps://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/why-do-men-go-bald-from-the-top-\nof-their-heads/\n\n[The End of Answer 2]\n\n[The Start of Reviewer 1's Evaluation]\n Here is my evaluation of the two answers:\n\nAnswer 1 provides a concise and coherent explanation for male pattern baldness, focusing on the sensitivity of hair follicles on the top of the head to DHT and less exposure to environmental damage.

It also mentions that the hair on the sides and back of the head is less exposed to environmental factors that can damage hair and lead to hair loss. This answer is coherent and provides a scientifically supported explanation for the pattern of hair loss.\n\nAnswer 2 provides a different theory, suggesting that the process begins during puberty when growth of the skull and muscles in the forehead and neck increases tension in a band of tissue over the top of the head. This tension, combined with the presence of DHT, leads to inflammation and restriction of blood and nutrient supply to the hair follicles, causing them to shrink and eventually disappear.

        "background": "[Question]\nHow do credit/debit cards work? What is the process of putting money in and\ngetting it out?\n\n[The Start of Answer 1]\nA credit or debit card is basically just an easy way to allow a shop to speak\nto your bank.  \nFirst you go into the bank, and you either deposit some cash into your account\n(debit), or you ask the bank nicely to cover you, and promise that you will\npay them back at the end of the month (credit).  \nThen you can go shopping. You get to the till with your products, which you\nnow need to pay for, but instead of handing over cash directly, you ask the\nshop to deal directly with your bank. The shop phones up the bank and asks\nthem to take X amount of money out of your account, then nip over to the shops\nown bank and give it to them on your behalf, which they do.  \nThat is pretty much how a credit or debit card works, just automated with\ncomputers...\n\n[The End of Answer 1]\n\n[The Start of Answer 2]\nDebit cards are linked to a bank account and whenever you pay using a debit\ncard, the amount is deducted from the bank account on completion of the\ntransaction. So, instead of withdrawing and handing over cash for a purchase,\nyou can swipe the card.  \nCredit cards come with a credit limit and a defined billing cycle (generally\nmonthly). So, you can make purchases using the credit card upto the defined\ncredit limit. The bill is generated as per the defined billing cycle and you\nare required to settle it just like the bills for any other utilities.  \nHope this helps.\n\n[The End of Answer 2]\n\n[The Start of Reviewer 1's Evaluation]\nAnswer 1:\n- Unsupported information: The answer includes the statement \"you ask the bank nicely to cover you.\" This statement is subjective and not a factual representation of how credit cards work.\n- Core information: The answer explains that credit cards allow a shop to communicate with the bank, and it describes the process of the shop requesting money from the bank on behalf of the cardholder.\n- Coherence: The answer is coherent and provides a clear explanation of the process.\n\nAnswer 2:\n- Unsupported information: The answer does not contain any unsupported information.\n- Core information: The answer explains that debit cards deduct the amount from the bank account immediately, while credit cards have a credit limit and require monthly bill settlement.\n- Coherence: The answer is coherent and provides a concise explanation of how debit and credit cards work.\n\nBased on the evaluation, both answers contain core information and are coherent. However, answer 1 includes unsupported information, while answer 2 does not. Therefore, answer 2 is the more accurate and reliable response.\n\n2\n\n[The End of Reviewer 1's Evaluation]\n\n[The Start of Reviewer 2's Evaluation]\nBoth Answer 1 and Answer 2 accurately describe how credit and debit cards work, and neither contains unsupported information. \n\nAnswer 1 provides a more detailed and narrative explanation, using an analogy of a shop speaking to your bank. It explains the process of depositing money into a bank account (for a debit card) or asking the bank to cover your expenses (for a credit card). It then describes how the shop communicates with your bank to transfer money from your account to the shop's account. This answer is coherent and easy to understand, especially for someone who may not be familiar with banking terms.\n\nAnswer 2, on the other hand, is more concise and uses more technical language. It explains that a debit card is linked to a bank account and the amount is deducted from the account when a purchase is made. It also explains that a credit card has a credit limit and a billing cycle, and that you can make purchases up to the credit limit. The bill is then generated and needs to be paid, similar to other utility bills. This answer is also coherent and accurate, but it may be less accessible to someone who is not familiar with banking terms.\n\nIn terms of core information, both answers explain the basic functions of credit and debit cards. However, Answer 1 provides a more detailed explanation of the process, while Answer 2 is more concise and to the point.\n\nIn conclusion, both answers are correct and coherent, but Answer 1 provides a more detailed and accessible explanation, while Answer 2 is more concise and uses more technical language.\n\n1\n\n[The End of Reviewer 2's Evaluation]\n\n[System]\nRead the reviews and discussions above, and make a decision if to change your preference, and explain. Remember we focus on unsupported information, core information and coherence.\nIn a new line, choose between answer 1 and answer 2 by outputting the number 1 or 2 respectively. Do not output anything else other than the number in this last line."
